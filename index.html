    <h1><b> <u> Denzel's bakery </u> </b></h1>
    <p> Denzel discovered his love for baking at a very young age of 10, when he was baking his first batch of chocolate chip cookies with his grandmother.
         The joy of creating something delicious from scratch enthralled him. Over the years, he honed his skills by experimenting with various recipes and 
         even creating some of his own. His dream is to share the joy of baking with others and inspire them to create their own baked wonders.</p>
    <h2> Classic Carrot Cake </h2>
    <p>  An homage to tradition and familial bonds, enriched with the natural sweetness of carrots and a crunch of walnuts, it holds a special place in his
         heart as it was his late grandfather's favorite. Every year on his grandfather's birthday, Denzel bakes this cake to honor his memory and the bond
          they shared over the love of baking. </p>
